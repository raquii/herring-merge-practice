# herring-merge-practice

We are going to practice creating and merging pull requests, including when there is a **merge conflict**.

## Instructions

1. `git clone` this repository
2. Create a new branch called `[JIRA TICKET]-add-[your_first_name]`:

    ```sh
    git checkout -b LJ-6-add-raquel-to-names
    ```

3. Add your name to the [List of Names](#list-of-names)
4. Commit and push your changes
5. Create a pull request for your branch
6. After I approve your changes, merge your branch:

   ```sh
   git merge origin/main
   ```

7. Resolve the conflicts as demonstrated
8. Complete the merge
